Not me though I took a half day started queuing at half 3 and managed to get in the pit when we finally got let in.

It was a glorious day for it I had to keep the wife's cardigan on my head in the lead up to the show in fear of getting sunburnt or sun stroke. Shame we didn't get Racing in the street as that's one of my favourite summer songs. Was great seeing Born In The USA and I'm going down live for the first time.

One of the best things about seeing him live is that it can make you appreciate a song you never really thought much of. Sandy is a song I don't tend to listen to but it's incredible moving live. Same for American Skin. Similarly the studio version of Point Blank doesn't do the live version justice.

I read somehwere that getting physically strong(er) really assists with self confidence and abates anxiety so as I don't really like public performances the gym wasn't an option. I discovered Kettlebells which I can do at home and I fuckin' love swinging those things about in the living room.

To be fair getting stronger and moving heavy metal objects really works for me personally and I feel a lot more confident and relaxed nowadays.

You don't have to get beefcake strong or go mad with bodybuilding. In fact you can get really quite strong without bulking out at all.

Something to ponder on perhaps? Although I have no idea if you are strong or not already :)

Those should get you going. You can do either one of the other or mix them up depending upon what you enjoy. I've always hated and avoided exercise in general except for walking so finding something which you enjoy doing is really important.

Happy to answer any additional queries on kettlebells if I can. I'm no expert but I've done a lot of reading on them.

I usually play it by ear. I water each a set amount expecting that they will tell me when they need more - cyclamens look droopy when they need more water a ficus must always have moist soil etc etc. If at any point the leaves start to discolour - test the soil - fading leaves and damp soil? Let it dry out. fading leaves and dry soil it? Give it some water.     
Plants communicate just as loudly as any pet you just need to learn to read them like a dog cat etc.    
Rice water or green tea and just wonderful for all plants.

Ok guys you need to get your shit together.     
Democracy Sausage is THE BEST THING about elections in Aus.     
Basically any time there's an election wherever the voting places are (usually schools) there is always a sausage sizzle. You get a sausage on a piece of cheap white bread with some sauce and fried onions  (optional). You pay about 50p or £1 (depending) and it goes to charity. This is necessary to all elections and is an essential Australian right. There's even a [map](http://democracysausage.org/) so you can make sure you'll get your damned Democracy Sausage at your local voting point.      
     
    
    
Please note the DS is essentially the same as the gloriously amazing Bunnings Sausage Sizzle available every Saturday and Sunday at your local Bunnings.

The Glasgow Market seems a little dead so I thought I'd post this here.

For sale: one baseball cap. Excellent condition. Only worn once but due to a rather traumatic experience (the wound is still a little too fresh for me to go into details) I have made a solemn vow to never wear a hat again.

£100 ono.

Also I have an extensive toy collection and the complete back catalogue of all Nu Metal bands circa 1996 - 2002 which again due to events I'm not willing to discuss I am looking to part with.

Again these are not going cheap as they are still dear to me and they are also a great conversation starter. No time wasters please serious offers only.","https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/4fratq/the_steamie_thursday_21_april_2016/d2bvz7o"

We signed up at the Glasgow shelter (yes Cardonald) where they take some personal details and determine if your lifestyle allows for a pet - really just a formality. Once you are in their system you can visit their other shelters to see the animals they have there. We ended up reserving our we guy at 6 weeks at the Lanarkshire shelter and picked him up when he was 8 weeks.

Buuuuut it's definitely going to be mega since most people alive in UK have only ever lived under her reign. Wonder what it will be like for the sectarian factors in West of Scotland.

If it helps you you can talk yourself through the routine each step of the way and nobody will bust your balls for it. It helped me for sure.

My strategy was to do one (and never more than one) mock test a day every day for eight weeks in the run up to the test but *not* to do a mock test the night before. Passed it comfortably first time.

My instructor maintained that the best way to learn your theory was to do those mock tests alongside your practical lessons since the actual driving lets you put into practice things like reading signs and anticipating hazards.

[Here's some bonus info on annual leave](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1374). You might need to build up that entitlement before you take it though. Every employee/worker in the uk is entitled to paid time off. It's pretty wonderful.

Easter is a four day weekend. Friday is Good Friday and Monday is Easter Monday. So both are bank holidays and are sometimes given to people as days off. Same with May Day (the first Monday in May) and the Queen's birthday (the last Monday in May). Tell you what [I'll just leave this here](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays#scotland).

"Monday","21/3/2016","9:6","MacBorracho","1","Did anyone else go to (Re)Imagining Glasgow at the GFT yesterday ?

Were you also a bit underwhelmed by what the film was against  expectations.

Did the Angry architect have an agenda he was going to express anyway he could. What route do you think he took on his bike from the West End to the GFT that made him uncomfortable. 

The Art school  lecturer stood out a bit with his continued use of tropes and patrician voice. He also got avatar in a few times.

The audience was a wee bit white/middle aged that doesnt really reflect Glasgow as it is and will be going forward.

The Page/Park architect tried to emphasis the fancy work the company does but missed out a lot of the social housing.

Overall something to build on but the film is already dated as buildings used have been demolished ( Anderston flats etc ).
A film that used images from outside the City Centre would be a bit more adventurous. It wanted iconic images but didnt really show Glasgow. What about Springburn/Drumchapel/Scotstoun/Darnley

For some of the negative predictions none of the architectsplanners and lecturers expressed awareness that they were the people who had been involved getting paid and doing this work for many years. It was always someone elses fault.

One of the unoccupied flats in our close has had a smoke alarm going off for about 24 hours now. We can't hear it but I feel really bad for their next door neighbours. The fire service couldn't get the door open and wouldn't go in through the window because the building is listed and they can't see any flames or smoke to justify the damage.

Our flat only joins our flat with my sisters room resulting in her pretty much living with her now ex boyfriend or sleeping in the living room for a good 2-3 months.  In that time the owner was pretty blaze about getting someone round to fix it because they were in London and therefore couldn't be arsed.  It took threatening the fire brigade smashing the door (which would happen my building isn't listed) before she conveniently sent someone round.

* Man in green kilt with collie.  I spot this guy all about the west end and even bumped into him on the West Highland Railway on the train.

* Old lady with lights on zimmer goes for her shopping pretty much every day along Great Western Road to Anniesland Morrisons.  She seems fairly old so the fact she walks from around Byres Road is impressive.  She must really hate Morrisons in Partick.

* Black man with umbrella.  He's always heading to Byres Road.  Again probably lives nearby but I spot him more than my neighbours in my close at times.

Having now done it twice successfully (by this I mean got the flat I wanted both times even with a lot of competition) in 2 years my top tips are:

* Set up instant email alerts on all the major rental websites (S1 RightMove Zoopla) for new flats matching your criteria
* Go on the 3 sites every morning and every afternoon.
* If you see one you like **phone** (NOT email) immediately and ask for a viewing.
* Take the first viewing possible as flats are normally taken by the first people or group viewing to see them.  Get out of work if possible to go to the viewing.
* Be professional when you show up to the viewing if there's competition for the flat your personal presentation will go a long way. Ask a lot of questions get to know the person showing the flat.

And if you're cutting the chicken up for curries or stir fries or whatever don't buy breast fillets. That's the most expensive cut.

So me and the mates decided instead of the usual house party we would make an effort suit up and go to a nice fancy hotel pub for the bells.
It was a good laugh but generally felt I'd rather just be with the pals listening to the music we like  not having to queue up for drinks and bathroom breaks and dealing with the occasional fucking roaster.
Costly night and I didnt even get proper pished cos of the off-putting queues. I was armed with a hip flask and a joint though so it wasnt too bad.

"Monday","14/12/2015","10:2","isopr0p","3","aye I usedty work in Tesco so I highly appreciate the fact that nobody really cares if I'm late. I mentioned in my interview for this place that I was gonna show up late like 3 days a week cause I'd rather have stayed where I was than move somewhere that was going to make a big deal of it. Pretty lucky I guess but I can see things moving towards semi-flexible working patterns for more sectors eventually.","https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/3wrc3x/the_steamie_monday_14_december_2015/cxyizct"
"Monday","14/12/2015","10:16","IncompetentFox","1","Can confirm Tesco are fucking cocks about lateness. Was chided at my last review for clocking out a minute early despite the fact they get a minimum of 45 minutes free out of me every week.

New job hunt will start in the new year. Maybe I'll go do a qualification or something.","https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/3wrc3x/the_steamie_monday_14_december_2015/cxyj66d"
"Monday","14/12/2015","10:35","isopr0p","1","I'm quite conflicted whenever I hear people saying they use real checkouts because they don't want self-service robots replacing humans. On the one hand that's very compassionate of you on the other hand... it's not really a fit job for a human is it? Sitting there all day. It's soul destroying actually. I used to struggle to get out of bed. I used to go to bed at night hoping I'd wake up the next morning and my job would have been replaced by the singularity.  

Here. What do you think - we had an ongoing debate in wishae if it was correctly Cardinal Caird or Cairdinal Card in a Scottish accent. Whose side are you on?

He was my manager when I started - 17 fresh-faced and ready to be an arsehole to everyone who it was possible to be an arsehole too. He was one of the good guys though. 

Quite a few times I've thought back to times where he went you'll look back and think that cunt was right about that and thought aw cunt he was right about that haha.","https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/3wrc3x/the_steamie_monday_14_december_2015/cxyl6wb"
